# Instructions

- Open POSTman

- Create a new call

- Open Tab Tests

- Copy paste the following script by replacing the URL with the appropriate one


## Usage

The script is doing multiple GET requests to the URL selected
We can set the  number of the requests by changing the iterations
Also we can set the maximum response time 

On this script we validate the expected response based on the number of iterations

By running the script you can check the console and the test results in order to see all the responses
